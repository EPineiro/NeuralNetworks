NeuralNetworks
==============

- Repository for experimentation with artificial neural networks

- Implementation of Neural Networks to experiment with them.

==========================================================================
- In the first version there is just a shallow network trained with stochastic gradient descent with momentum.
- Using a learning rate of 0.001, regularization parameter of 0.1, momentum coefficient of 0.1, 30 hidden neurons and trained for 30 epochs with a mini batch size of 10 I get aprox. 91-92% of accuracy on MNIST dataset
